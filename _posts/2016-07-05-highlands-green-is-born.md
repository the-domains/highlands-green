  Bags of t-shirts and jeans, baby clothes filled the hallway along with medical
  and humanitarian supplies in black garbage bags and rice sacks. The faint

Baw Boe, a karen from Burma brought in a sack of fresh turmeric root. Michel Vandenhautte, our neighbour and jungle medic, hands stained yellow from squeezing the fresh turmeric to take the edge of the pain. A parasite roaming freely through his body laying eggs, the "unwanted gift" of a tiny opportunistic tick.

The sack of fresh turmeric, a precious cargo for their beloved doctor who helped save many lives performing medical triage in the depths of the burmese jungle. Michel Vandenhautte, M.D. was now the recipient of their toil and sweat. That's when I began to put "two and two" together. Could we do something to help them, help us and help others as well.
