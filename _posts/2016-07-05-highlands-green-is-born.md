Highlands Green is Born...

Bags of t-shirts and jeans, baby clothes filled the hallway along with medical and humanitarian supplies in black garbage bags and rice sacks. The faint smell of diesel in the driveway and sturdy men packing the trucks.

Bobo, our karen contact brought in a sack of fresh turmeric root. Michel our neighbour and jungle medic, hands stained yellow from squeezing the fresh turmeric to take the edge of the pain. A parasite roaming freely through his body laying eggs, the "unwanted gift" of a tiny tick.

The sack of fresh turmeric, a precious cargo for their beloved doctor who helped save many lives performing medical triage in the depths of the burmese jungle. Michel Vandenhautte, M.D. was now the recipient of their toil and sweat. 

That's how Highlands Green became a reality in June 2015
